The files in this directory are scripts that you can run on the Cisco IOS/ASA to set up the outside interface, SSH/Telnet, and passwords. IMPORTANT: Don't forget to change the public IP address of the gateway!

The inside interface (or Cisco subnet) is set up using a DHCP server. This is done in the script as there are test cases that varies the subnet settings behind the Cisco gateway.
